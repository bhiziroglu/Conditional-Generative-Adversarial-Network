# Conditional-Generative-Adversarial-Network
This repo contains a tutorial and an implementation of the [Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf) paper. 
The model is written in PyTorch and familiarity with the original [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf) is assumed.

## Usage

1) Clone the repository
